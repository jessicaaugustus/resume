phylogenetic analyses of archaea; machine learning
algorithms to detect open reading frames in large data sets.
Molecular cloning to identify molecular signals controlling
neural development. Analyzed retinal neuron firing patterns to
infer properties of mammalian visual processing.

Institute for Behavioral genetics: Used various
statistical/clustering techniques eg mcmc and hmm'sto detect
confounding factors in large scale genetic association studies
of molecular neural markers of addiction.

UC Boulder: MCBD: aligned ribosomal RNA's using Wrote custom
python scripts to identify distinct clusters of microbial
communities in the environment
